# Stephen has already done this for part of the code origonally, code needs amalgamated and superfluous script deleted

# brings in the data in raw tile format as it is from now coast. This will also mean that other predictors i.e hurricanes, TSM,
# sediment and gravel will need to be split out over the tiles / sub grid
